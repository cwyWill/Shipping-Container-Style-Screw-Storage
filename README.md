## Introduction
This is a screw storage design comes with three different size, 30mm, 40mm, and 50mm. The container uses this dimension as the base length and you can choose the number of base length used in each dimension. For example, a 30mm h1xL3xW2 container will be 30mm tall, 90mm long, and 60mm wide.

Every container comes with its own lid and label. The repository offers hundreds of labels to choose from.


## Who Might Be Intersted

+ When you only have a few variations of parts but don’t want to print a super large case.
+ You want individual containers that can be enclosed and carried around without a huge case.
+ You don’t want to create labels manually yourself for common part types. Just choose from the files I generated.
+ You want (over) sturdy part containers.
+ You like shipping container style.
